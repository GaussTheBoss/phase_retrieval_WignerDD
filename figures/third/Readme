This folder contains third party software. Note that none of
these packages are necessary for the proposed algorithm from the 
manuscript to work. They are included in order to compare with 
implementations of other existing and popular algorithms. 

In particular, this folder contains an installation of TFOCS.

The license terms under which TFOCS is distributed can found in
the file TFOCS/LICENSE

Note: The initialization routine for TFOCS at
TFOCS/private/tfocs_initialize.m      
has been replaced by a modified version written by Mahdi
Soltanolkotabi (http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~soltanol/PRcode.html).
